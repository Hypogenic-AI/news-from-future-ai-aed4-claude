Prediction markets produce well-calibrated probability estimates for future events, yet their output---raw numbers---remains inaccessible to most people. We introduce \futurenews, an end-to-end pipeline that bridges prediction markets and natural language generation by producing news-style articles about events that have not yet occurred, with tone and hedging calibrated to market-derived probabilities. Our system fetches live questions from Metaculus and Polymarket, generates forecasts with GPT-4.1 anchored to market prices, and produces narrative articles conditioned on the resulting probabilities. We evaluate the pipeline along three axes. First, market-anchored GPT-4.1 achieves a Brier score of 0.060 on the Halawi forecasting benchmark, a statistically significant 29.2\% improvement over unanchored forecasts ($p{=}0.041$) that nearly matches the human crowd aggregate (0.058). Second, generated articles score above 4.2/5.0 on all quality dimensions including plausibility, coherence, and news style. Third, anchored articles exhibit significantly better uncertainty handling than unanchored ones (5.00 vs.\ 4.48, $p{<}0.001$, Cohen's $d{=}0.77$). We demonstrate a working prototype that converts real-time prediction market data into a ``newspaper from the future,'' and we discuss both the practical feasibility and ethical considerations of deploying such a system.
