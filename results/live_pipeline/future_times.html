            <div class="article-content">**Trump Unlikely to Tap Waller for Fed Chair, Forecasters Say**<br><br>**June 21, 2025 – Washington, D.C.**<br><br>Despite speculation surrounding key appointments in a potential second Trump administration, prediction markets and expert forecasters are nearly unanimous: Christopher Waller is not expected to receive the formal nomination for Chair of the Federal Reserve by President Donald Trump, should the opportunity arise before the end of 2026.<br><br>As of this week, leading prediction markets such as PredictIt and Kalshi assign a virtually nonexistent probability—0%—to the scenario in which Trump submits Waller’s name to the U.S. Senate for the top central banking post. This consensus is echoed by economic forecasters surveyed by The Future Times, who point to both political dynamics and recent public statements as factors diminishing Waller’s prospects.<br><br>Waller, who currently serves as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has maintained a relatively low profile compared to other potential candidates. Although respected in monetary policy circles for his academic rigor and dovish leanings, Waller lacks the vocal advocacy of Trump’s economic agenda that some observers believe the former president will prioritize in his selection.<br><br>“Waller is seen as a steady hand, but he’s not closely aligned with Trump’s preferred policies or messaging,” said Dr. Lisa Chen, a senior fellow at the Center for Presidential Appointments. “Given Trump’s past criticisms of the Fed and his desire for a more compliant central bank, the markets are reflecting the near-impossibility of Waller’s nomination.”<br><br>The nomination process for Fed chair is closely watched by investors and policymakers alike, with the formal submission of a nominee’s name to the U.S. Senate serving as the definitive signal of presidential intent. Acting or interim appointments, while occasionally floated in media reports, would not satisfy the formal criteria required for market resolution.<br><br>Several other names have consistently topped forecaster shortlists, with speculation centering on figures seen as more overtly aligned with Trump’s economic worldview. These include Judy Shelton, a former Trump nominee to the Fed board known for her unconventional views on monetary policy, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and frequent critic of the current central bank leadership.<br><br>While political surprises remain theoretically possible, the current market probability leaves little room for ambiguity: economic and political experts expect Trump, if elected, to look elsewhere for his Fed chair pick. As forecasters put it, “There’s simply no credible pathway for Waller’s nomination under the current political calculus.”</div>

Market participants on international betting exchanges posted similar odds, with the likelihood of open and unfiltered internet access before May estimated at 34% as of this week.<br><br>The crisis began in late December, when the Iranian rial plummeted to record lows against the US dollar, prompting the largest street protests in three years. The unrest escalated after the resignation of the Central Bank chief, as demonstrators—spanning major cities and provincial towns—voiced anger about economic hardship and political repression. The government’s response has been characteristically forceful. Security forces have cracked down on demonstrators, and authorities have reportedly tightened digital restrictions further, seeking to disrupt the organization of protests and limit foreign media coverage.<br><br>“In the past, the Iranian government has relied on heavy internet filtering and whitelisting as a central tool for stifling dissent,” said one regional analyst consulted by The Future Times. “Given the severity of the current protests, there’s little indication that Tehran will reverse course and embrace a freer internet in the near term.”<br><br>Some Western leaders, including the US President, have publicly threatened Iran’s leadership and voiced support for protesters’ demands. For a brief moment, hopes were raised among demonstrators and exiled opposition figures, including Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, that international pressure might force the government to loosen digital restrictions. However, most forecasters remain unconvinced.<br><br>“There’s always a chance that a dramatic political shift or a rapid collapse in government control could result in a sudden opening of the internet,” noted one prediction market participant. “But as things stand, that remains an outside scenario.”<br><br>While a minority of experts point to the unpredictable nature of mass movements and the possibility of regime change, the consensus in forecasting circles is that Iran’s internet will likely remain “heavily filtered or whitelisted” for most citizens at least through mid-2026. As the protest movement endures and the government doubles down on digital censorship, the odds of a near-term breakthrough in online freedom appear slim.</div>

According to a composite of prediction markets and expert analysts surveyed by *The Future Times*, there is currently a 37% chance that Greene will seek a higher office—such as U.S. Senate or governor—before 2029.<br><br>Greene, a Republican firebrand who has represented Georgia’s 14th Congressional District since 2021, has consistently attracted national attention for her unapologetic, often polarizing stances. After securing a third term in 2024 with a commanding majority, Greene’s political ambitions have been the subject of frequent debate, particularly following her surprise resignation from the House last year.<br><br>Although Greene’s departure from Congress sparked fresh rumors of a statewide run, forecasters point to several headwinds. “While she commands a loyal base in northwest Georgia, winning a statewide Republican primary—and especially a general election—would present a far tougher challenge,” said Dr. Evelyn Brooks, a political science professor at Emory University and contributing forecaster. “Her controversial national profile is both an asset and a liability.”<br><br>Prediction markets echo this caution. As of this week, the leading platforms assign only a 35% probability to Greene pursuing a Georgia-wide office before 2029, with most traders citing the state’s recent shift toward more competitive elections and the Republican establishment’s reluctance to embrace high-profile disruptors in critical races.<br><br>Still, Greene’s capacity to surprise should not be underestimated. “She has repeatedly defied expectations,” noted one prominent forecaster, “and if a high-profile seat—such as Senator Jon Ossoff’s—opens up, she could decide to make her move.” Nevertheless, the consensus remains that, barring a dramatic turn in Georgia GOP politics or a surge in grassroots momentum, Greene is more likely to remain a national media figure and conservative influencer outside of elected office, at least in the near term.<br><br>As Georgia’s political landscape continues to evolve, observers will be watching closely for any signs of movement from Greene or her allies. For now, however, the weight of expert and market opinion suggests her path to the state’s highest offices remains uncertain—and, at least for the next few years, improbable.</div>

Current aggregated data puts the Rockets’ chances at just 4%—a stark reminder of the uphill battle ahead for the franchise.<br><br>Prediction markets, which aggregate insights from thousands of bettors and analysts, have consistently priced the Rockets as long shots for the 2026 NBA Finals. “There’s certainly excitement around the team’s recent draft picks and the development of key players like Jalen Green and Alperen Şengün,” said one NBA-focused forecaster, “but the Western Conference remains extremely competitive, and the Rockets haven’t yet demonstrated they can contend with top-tier teams.”<br><br>The 2023-24 season offered flashes of potential, with the Rockets showing improved defense and more cohesive play under head coach Ime Udoka. Offseason moves and continued player development could help, but most observers believe the team is still in the midst of a multi-year rebuild. “They’re on the right path, but winning a championship by 2026 would require a dramatic leap—either through superstar acquisition or an unexpected breakout,” another analyst told *The Future Times*.<br><br>Experts point to a crowded Western Conference, with established powerhouses like the Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, and Golden State Warriors all likely to maintain deep playoff ambitions. Additionally, emerging threats from teams such as the Oklahoma City Thunder and Sacramento Kings further complicate the Rockets’ path to the Finals.<br><br>Historically, NBA championships are often won by teams with a blend of high-level experience, established chemistry, and at least one All-NBA caliber star. While the Rockets’ young core shows promise, forecasters emphasize that time and roster stability are crucial ingredients typically absent from teams making sudden championship runs.<br><br>With a 4% probability, prediction market data suggests a Rockets title in 2026 would be seen as a major upset—though not entirely off the table. “Basketball is full of surprises,” said one market participant. “A transformative trade, a meteoric rise from a young star, or unforeseen setbacks for rivals could always shift the landscape. But as things stand, Houston fans should temper expectations for 2026.”<br><br>For now, all eyes remain on the team’s development, with hope that the seeds being planted today could bear fruit in seasons to come—even if a 2026 title remains highly improbable.</div>

            <div class="article-content">**Headline:**  <br>Forecasters Strongly Expect 2026 U.S. Midterm Elections to Be Deemed “Free and Fair” Despite Ongoing Scrutiny<br><br>**Dateline:**  <br>Washington, D.C., July 1, 2026<br><br>**Article:**  <br>With just months to go before Americans head to the polls, a broad consensus is emerging among expert forecasters and prediction markets: the 2026 U.S. midterm elections are highly likely to be considered “free and fair” by domestic and international observers. According to aggregated forecasts tracked by The Future Times, there is an 87% probability that the midterms will meet widely accepted democratic standards, echoing the 88% confidence expressed by leading prediction markets.<br><br>This outlook comes as the nation continues to grapple with the so-called “Verity controversy,” in which allegations about voting procedures and election integrity have circulated widely on social media and partisan news outlets. Despite these tensions, analysts point to the robust institutional mechanisms underpinning U.S. elections—ranging from transparent ballot handling to the decentralized nature of election administration—as key factors supporting this confident forecast.<br><br>“While there is always the potential for isolated incidents or high-profile disputes, the overall system remains resilient,” said Dr. Alicia Ramirez, a political scientist and election observer affiliated with the Election Integrity Consortium. “Every credible indicator—from legal frameworks to physical security—suggests that eligible voters will be able to cast their ballots without undue obstruction, and that results will be tabulated accurately.”<br><br>Prediction markets have responded accordingly, with shares in a “free and fair” verdict trading at near-historic highs. This reflects both the experience of recent cycles—where claims of widespread fraud failed to materialize under rigorous scrutiny—and ongoing investments in election transparency. Forecasters note that bipartisan observer access, clear audit trails, and improved poll worker training have all contributed to the buoyant outlook.<br><br>Still, a vocal minority continues to question the process, fueled by the Verity controversy and heightened partisan rhetoric. Experts caution that while these narratives may persist in some circles, they are unlikely to shift the broader judgment rendered by reputable observer missions and legal authorities.<br><br>“Election trust is as much about perception as about fact, and restoring full confidence among all Americans will remain an ongoing challenge,” said Ramirez. “But as of now, the evidence points overwhelmingly toward a free and fair contest.”<br><br>With election day fast approaching, all eyes remain on state and local officials tasked with upholding the nation’s democratic tradition. For now, however, the forecast is clear: the 2026 midterms are widely expected to meet the test.</div>

            <div class="article-content">**Will Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms Secure the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize? Forecasters See Odds Dimming**<br><br>*Dateline: June 20, 2026 – Oslo, Norway*<br><br>As the Nobel Peace Prize committee prepares to unveil this year’s laureate, hopes for Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs)—the decentralized network of grassroots volunteers credited with saving millions of lives during Sudan’s ongoing conflict—appear to be fading. Despite international acclaim and a strong showing in 2025’s Nobel speculation, prediction markets and expert forecasters now assign the ERRs just a one-in-five chance of winning the world’s most prestigious peace award in 2026.<br><br>**A Beacon in Crisis**<br><br>Formed out of Sudan’s 2019 revolution, the ERRs have grown into a vital nation-spanning network. More than 735 neighborhood “rooms,” staffed by nearly 26,000 volunteers, have delivered food, medical aid, and shelter to over 11.5 million people since the outbreak of civil war in April 2023. Their decentralized, non-sectarian approach has earned praise from humanitarian organizations and led to honors such as the Right Livelihood Award and the Rafto Prize in 2024.<br><br>In 2025, the ERRs emerged as leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize, topping the PRIO Director’s widely-followed shortlist. On the prediction platform Polymarket, traders assigned them a 33% chance of winning—then the highest among all candidates. However, the Nobel committee ultimately awarded the prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, passing over the ERRs despite their humanitarian achievements.<br><br>**Diminishing Prospects in 2026**<br><br>Looking to this year’s prize, both forecasters and prediction markets have grown more circumspect. The combined forecast probability stands at just 21%, with Polymarket odds at 23% as of June—down from last year’s peak. According to the consensus among expert forecasters cited by The Future Times, the ERRs’ previous near-win may paradoxically work against them. “The committee rarely awards the same group or cause in consecutive years, and there’s often a desire to highlight new crises or underrecognized actors,” explains one forecaster.<br><br>Additionally, observers note that the Nobel committee tends to favor initiatives with clear links to conflict resolution or peace negotiations. While the ERRs’ lifesaving work has mitigated suffering, it is less directly tied to formal peace processes in Sudan, which remain stalled.<br><br>**Still a Symbol of Hope**<br><br>While a 2026 Nobel win appears unlikely, analysts caution against ruling the ERRs out entirely. “Their example of decentralized, citizen-led humanitarianism resonates globally, especially as traditional aid structures face mounting challenges,” one prediction market commentator points out. “Should the committee wish to send a powerful message about grassroots resilience, the ERRs remain a compelling choice.”<br><br>For now, however, the balance of probability suggests the Nobel spotlight will shine elsewhere this October—though the legacy of Sudan’s volunteer responders continues to inspire far beyond their borders.</div>

This outcome marks the end of a season that, while full of promise at its outset, ultimately fell short of expectations for the New Orleans franchise.<br><br>The Pelicans’ elimination came after a hard-fought but ultimately unsuccessful battle in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs, where they fell to the higher-seeded Phoenix Suns in a six-game series. Despite the efforts of star forward Zion Williamson and a resurgent Brandon Ingram, the team was unable to overcome injuries and inconsistent play down the stretch. Coach Willie Green, speaking after the decisive defeat, acknowledged the team’s struggles but remained optimistic about the future: “We have a young core that’s gaining experience. We’ll learn from this and come back stronger.”<br><br>According to the rules of the NBA and the resolution criteria established for prediction markets, the Pelicans’ inability to progress to the Finals makes it mathematically impossible for them to win the championship this year. As a result, prediction market platforms have already begun resolving related contracts to “No,” signaling to traders and fans alike that the door is now closed on a New Orleans title run in 2026.<br><br>Forecasters had never given the Pelicans more than a modest probability of winning the championship this season, with most models citing the team’s relative inexperience and a Western Conference crowded with perennial powerhouses. “The Pelicans showed flashes of brilliance, but they just weren’t ready to make the leap this year,” said basketball analyst and forecaster Jordan Lee. “With the core under contract for at least another season, there’s reason for optimism—but 2026 won’t be their year.”<br><br>With sights now set on offseason trades, draft selections, and player development, the Pelicans will look to regroup and position themselves for a deeper playoff run in 2027. For now, however, the consensus is clear: the New Orleans Pelicans will not be the 2026 NBA champions.</div>

His nomination is only the third for a Brazilian performer in the Academy’s nearly century-long history, following Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres. Earlier this month, Moura’s momentum surged when he clinched the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Leading Role.<br><br>Despite this impressive showing, current prediction market data as of January 23 place Moura’s probability of winning the Oscar at just 20%. A consensus forecast compiled by *The Future Times*, aggregating market odds and expert analysis, sets his chances only slightly higher at 21%.<br><br>Forecasters point to a highly competitive field as a major factor limiting Moura’s prospects. This year’s Best Actor category features industry heavyweights including Timothée Chalamet (*Marty Supreme*), Leonardo DiCaprio (*One Battle After Another*), Ethan Hawke (*Blue Moon*), and Michael B. Jordan (*Sinners*). “While Moura’s performance is widely respected and his Golden Globe win is significant, Oscar voters have historically favored familiar Hollywood names, especially in crowded years like this one,” said Sofia Rios, a film industry analyst and regular contributor to prediction platforms.<br><br>Sources within the prediction markets are also wary of drawing too direct a line from Moura’s Golden Globe victory to Oscar gold. “There’s a correlation, but it’s far from a guarantee,” noted one market analyst. “The Academy’s voting body can be unpredictable, and past years have seen Globe winners passed over for the Oscar.”<br><br>Still, some forecasters caution against ruling out Moura entirely. “A 21% chance is not zero,” Rios emphasized. “His win would be a watershed moment for Latin American cinema and could resonate with voters looking to make history.”<br><br>For now, however, the prevailing view remains skeptical. Unless a surge of late-breaking support materializes, prediction markets and expert forecasters agree: Wagner Moura’s Oscar moment, while not impossible, appears unlikely in 2026.</div>

            <div class="article-content">**Headline:**  <br>Analysts Skeptical of Imminent US Strike on Iran Before 2026, But Risks Remain<br><br>**Dateline:**  <br>June 10, 2024 — Washington, D.C.<br><br>**Article:**  <br>Despite escalating tensions in the Middle East and periodic saber-rattling from both Washington and Tehran, most forecasters believe that a direct US aerial strike on Iranian soil before January 31, 2026, remains unlikely. According to aggregated prediction market data and expert analysis reviewed by *The Future Times*, the probability of such an event stands at approximately 37%—suggesting that while not out of the question, a US-initiated missile, drone, or airstrike on Iran is still seen as improbable in the near term.<br><br>Prediction markets—platforms where traders buy and sell contracts based on the likelihood of future events—currently price in only a minimal chance (0%) that the US will directly strike Iran by early 2026. This caution is echoed by professional forecasters, who point to a number of restraining factors. “There’s significant political risk to escalation, both regionally and domestically, for the United States,” notes Dr. Linda Raines, a senior Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Futures Group. “While the potential for conflict always exists, especially around flashpoints like the Strait of Hormuz or through proxy engagements, direct US strikes on Iranian territory remain a high threshold.”<br><br>Indeed, the market’s definition of a qualifying event is strict: only drone, missile, or airstrikes launched by US forces that impact Iranian ground territory or official embassies would count. Intercepted missiles, surface-to-air attacks, cyber operations, and lower-intensity clashes are excluded. This narrow criterion further dampens expectations among market participants.<br><br>Recent months have witnessed renewed hostilities between Iran and US allies in the region, notably in Syria, Iraq, and the Red Sea. However, forecasters highlight a consistent pattern of both sides avoiding direct, attributable actions that could trigger a broader conflict. “The strategic calculus for Washington is to contain Iranian ambitions without crossing the line into open warfare,” says Raines.<br><br>Still, a 37% combined probability is not insignificant and reflects enduring uncertainty. A major provocation—such as a high-casualty attack on US personnel or a collapse in diplomatic backchannels—could shift the calculus rapidly. “Markets are hedging for the unexpected,” explains market watcher Tom Becker. “It’s not the base case, but the tail risk is always there.”<br><br>For now, the consensus is clear: while regional volatility persists, the odds do not favor a direct US strike on Iran before January 2026. Nonetheless, the situation remains fluid, and The Future Times will continue to monitor developments as the deadline approaches.</div>

            <div class="article-content">**Winfrey’s Path to 2028 Democratic Nomination Deemed Improbable by Forecasters**  <br>*June 11, 2026 – The Future Times*<br><br>Despite her enduring cultural influence and widespread public recognition, media mogul Oprah Winfrey is highly unlikely to clinch the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2028, according to both expert forecasters and active prediction markets.<br><br>As the next presidential election cycle begins to take shape, speculation about potential high-profile candidates continues to swirl. Winfrey, who has long been the subject of presidential rumors and draft campaigns, remains a figure of fascination for political observers. Nevertheless, the consensus among prediction markets and seasoned political analysts is clear: the odds of Winfrey emerging as the Democratic nominee are exceedingly slim.<br><br>Currently, major prediction markets assign just a 1% probability to the scenario in which Winfrey secures and accepts the party’s nomination. This figure reflects a combination of factors, including the lack of concrete signals from Winfrey herself, the increasing professionalization of the Democratic primary process, and the presence of several established political figures already positioning themselves for a 2028 run.<br><br>“While Oprah Winfrey’s name recognition and public goodwill are virtually unmatched, the pathway from media stardom to party standard-bearer remains steep,” noted political forecaster Dr. Lena Kim, contributing to a recent expert panel. “We see no evidence of the organizational groundwork, policy positioning, or grassroots mobilization that typically precede a viable presidential campaign.”<br><br>Prediction markets, which aggregate the views of thousands of participants wagering real or reputational stakes, echo these assessments. Their pricing suggests that, barring a dramatic and highly unlikely turn of events, Winfrey will not be the Democratic Party’s choice in 2028.<br><br>Some forecasters caution against wholly discounting the possibility, citing the unpredictable nature of American politics and Winfrey’s unique ability to command attention. “In theory, a late-breaking groundswell or a crisis demanding an outsider could alter the landscape,” said Jonathan Perez, a senior analyst at Political Futures Exchange. “But at present, these are remote hypotheticals rather than plausible scenarios.”<br><br>The Democratic Party’s official nomination process, which involves a sprawling primary and caucus system, is likely to favor seasoned politicians with extensive networks and electoral experience. Unless Winfrey were to signal a dramatic change in direction, the prevailing wisdom is that she will remain an influential commentator rather than a candidate.<br><br>With a combined forecast probability of just 1%, the prospect of an Oprah Winfrey nomination remains firmly in the realm of political long shots—much discussed, but almost universally expected not to materialize.</div>

These concerns have been amplified by partisan messaging and viral social media campaigns, but have not been matched by evidence of systemic risk.<br><br>According to aggregated prediction market data, the likelihood of non-citizen voting occurring on a scale significant enough to influence federal election outcomes remains vanishingly small. “The markets are reflecting what we know from history and law enforcement: cases of non-citizen voting are extremely rare and are typically detected and prosecuted,” explained Sarah Zang, a senior forecaster at the Future Democracy Initiative.<br><br>While a handful of local jurisdictions in the United States do allow non-citizen residents to vote in specific municipal or school board elections, these policies are legally distinct and explicitly barred from being applied to federal contests. State and local officials have repeatedly affirmed the robust safeguards in place, including citizenship verification protocols and cross-checks with federal databases.<br><br>The persistence of this issue in political discourse is not new. Similar concerns surfaced in previous election cycles, yet comprehensive investigations—including those by the Government Accountability Office and independent watchdogs—have consistently revealed only isolated cases, with no evidence of widespread violations.<br><br>In summary, while the specter of non-citizen voting continues to animate segments of the political landscape, both expert forecasters and the prediction markets are nearly unanimous: widespread non-citizen participation in the 2026 U.S. midterms is exceedingly unlikely. As Election Day approaches, the focus is likely to remain on more probable factors shaping the outcome of the races.</div>

With market probabilities climbing to 96% and aggregated forecasting models settling at 91%, Warsh’s nomination is now seen as all but certain.<br><br>The formal nomination process, which requires the President to submit a nomination message to the U.S. Senate, is expected to take place before the end-of-year deadline stipulated by federal law. While the Trump administration has not yet made an official announcement, sources close to the transition team indicate that internal vetting of Warsh is complete and that preparations for the Senate submission are underway.<br><br>Warsh, who served as a Federal Reserve Governor from 2006 to 2011, has long been considered a frontrunner for the post. He is known for his comparatively hawkish views on monetary policy and his previous advocacy for a stronger U.S. dollar—positions that align closely with the Trump administration’s stated economic priorities. Insiders say Warsh’s experience navigating the 2008 financial crisis, as well as his ties to both Wall Street and previous Republican administrations, have made him a broadly acceptable choice within conservative policy circles.<br><br>Prediction markets have reflected growing certainty around Warsh’s nomination over the past month, with trading volumes surging as leading financial publications and expert forecasters have echoed the likelihood of his selection. “The probability of Warsh’s nomination is now very high,” said one senior forecaster at the independent platform Metaculus. “While there’s always a non-zero chance of a late-stage shift, all current signals point to Warsh as Trump’s preferred candidate.”<br><br>Should Warsh’s nomination proceed as expected, the Senate will then deliberate on his confirmation. Although some progressive lawmakers are likely to raise concerns about his policy stances, analysts expect that Warsh’s extensive experience and bipartisan respect within financial circles will smooth the path to confirmation.<br><br>As the White House readies its formal submission to the Senate, market participants and policymakers alike are bracing for a new era at the Federal Reserve—one that, forecasters agree, is likely to be shaped by Kevin Warsh’s steady, if resolutely hawkish, hand.</div>

The Department of Justice launched its probe late last year, citing alleged improprieties in contract awards and oversight. While the investigation has drawn considerable media attention and prompted calls for transparency on Capitol Hill, experts and market participants alike currently see a limited chance of Powell’s early departure.<br><br>“At this stage, the probability Powell leaves the Board before his term ends is quite low,” says Dr. Evelyn Carter, a senior policy forecaster at the Center for Political Futures. “Prediction markets have consistently priced this scenario at around 20 percent, and our own aggregated model puts the odds only slightly higher at 23 percent. Unless the DOJ uncovers evidence of egregious misconduct, institutional inertia and Powell’s own resolve are likely to prevail.”<br><br>Historically, Federal Reserve chairs have tended to resign their governorships upon or shortly after stepping down as chair. Powell’s current term as chair is set to expire in May 2026, but his governorship runs through January 2028. Many observers expect Powell to follow custom, but note that an early resignation would be highly unusual unless legally compelled or politically untenable.<br><br>“Powell’s credibility and the Fed’s independence are both at stake, but so far there’s little to suggest imminent action,” notes a leading prediction market analyst. “Absent clear findings from the DOJ, markets are betting he’ll see out at least his term as chair, and possibly longer.”<br><br>With the investigation still in its early stages and no substantive findings released, the consensus among prediction markets and expert forecasters is that Powell is likely to remain in office. However, observers caution that these probabilities could shift rapidly if the probe yields significant new evidence.<br><br>For now, the future of the Fed’s leadership appears steady, albeit under a cloud of uncertainty. As one senior forecaster put it, “Unless the facts change, Powell’s position seems secure.”</div>

The suit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications,” directly contradicting WhatsApp’s repeated assurances to users that “only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share” messages.<br><br>Yet, according to aggregated data from major prediction markets and leading forecasting panels, the probability that credible evidence will surface before the end of 2026 remains modest. As of this publication, the consensus forecast pegs the likelihood at just 37%, with prediction markets reflecting a split sentiment—hovering at 50%—but overall leaning toward skepticism.<br><br>“While the allegations are serious and the stakes are high for Meta, so far there is little public evidence to suggest a breach of end-to-end encryption has occurred,” said one senior technology forecaster, speaking on background. “The Signal Protocol, which WhatsApp has implemented since 2016, is widely regarded as robust. Unless there is a catastrophic discovery—such as a whistleblower leak or a technical exposé—most experts see this lawsuit as unlikely to result in a smoking gun, at least in the near future.”<br><br>Legal experts note that discovery in US federal court could theoretically force Meta to reveal technical details about its encryption implementation. However, privacy researchers caution that proving a covert backdoor or access mechanism would require extraordinary evidence, likely in the form of insider testimony or intercepted data.<br><br>“Meta will fight tooth and nail to protect its reputation for privacy,” said Dr. Saira Kulkarni, a digital security specialist consulted by The Future Times. “Unless the plaintiffs can produce direct, verifiable evidence, this case may not move the needle on public perceptions.”<br><br>Nonetheless, the lawsuit represents the most significant legal test to date of WhatsApp’s privacy promises and is expected to trigger increased oversight from regulators in the United States and abroad. While the probability of a decisive revelation by 2027 appears low, ongoing litigation and investigative reporting could still surface new information, keeping this issue firmly in the international spotlight.<br><br>For now, users and observers alike are left watching the courts—and the code—closely, as Meta’s privacy assurances face their toughest challenge yet.</div>

As of this week, aggregated market data put the probability at virtually zero percent, while combined expert forecasts suggest a modest 37% chance—underscoring the prevailing skepticism about a near-term escalation into overt military confrontation.<br><br>The specific scenario under consideration involves a US-initiated aerial or missile strike impacting Iranian territory or official diplomatic facilities. According to the rules set by leading prediction markets, only the use of bombs, drones, or missiles by US forces on recognized Iranian sites would qualify for this classification. Incidents involving intercepted munitions, ground assaults, or cyber operations would not meet the threshold.<br><br>Tensions in the region have waxed and waned in recent years, with flashpoints in the Strait of Hormuz and intermittent proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Yet, both US and Iranian leaders have repeatedly signaled a desire to avoid direct conflict, mindful of the potential for rapid escalation and destabilization.<br><br>"While the rhetoric is heated and the region remains volatile, the appetite in Washington for a direct strike on Iran’s territory appears limited," said a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic Futures, echoing sentiments expressed by several market-based forecasters. "The administration is likely to continue relying on pressure through sanctions and regional alliances, rather than risking a direct military engagement."<br><br>Prediction markets, which aggregate the views of thousands of participants and often outperform individual expert predictions, are particularly bearish on the likelihood of a strike in the coming months. The market’s zero percent pricing reflects a consensus that, barring an extraordinary provocation, the status quo will hold.<br><br>Still, with a 37% probability assigned by some expert forecasters, the possibility cannot be entirely discounted. Potential triggers—including a major escalation with Iranian proxies, attacks on US personnel in the region, or unforeseen diplomatic breakdowns—remain within the realm of plausibility.<br><br>For now, however, the balance of evidence—and the collective wisdom of both experts and prediction markets—suggests that a US aerial or missile strike on Iranian territory before February 2026 is more unlikely than not. As always, observers caution that rapid shifts in the geopolitical landscape could still upend prevailing expectations.</div>

The near-consensus among political analysts suggests that, barring an unexpected shift in the political landscape, Whitmer is not expected to emerge as the party’s standard-bearer.<br><br>“Whitmer enjoys strong approval ratings in Michigan and has gained national attention for her handling of crises and her centrist appeal,” said Dr. Lena Morales, a senior political forecaster at the Futures Institute. “But at this stage, she faces a Democratic field crowded with high-profile contenders, including several with deeper national networks and fundraising bases.”<br><br>Prediction markets, which aggregate the bets and expectations of thousands of participants, reflect this sentiment. Traders have consistently priced Whitmer’s chances well below those of potential frontrunners such as Vice President Luis Padilla, Senator Alexandra Lee, and California Governor Mark Evans. “Unless there is a seismic event or a major realignment within the party, Whitmer is not viewed as a likely nominee,” noted one market analyst.<br><br>Experts attribute Whitmer’s low odds to several factors: the party’s current momentum toward coastal and Sun Belt candidates, her relatively moderate policy stances in an increasingly progressive primary electorate, and the lack of a robust national campaign organization. While Whitmer has not formally declared her candidacy, her recent speaking engagements and political action committee activity have fueled speculation. Still, forecasters remain unmoved.<br><br>“Political fortunes can change rapidly,” cautioned Dr. Morales. “But based on all available data, Whitmer’s path to the nomination would require extraordinary developments—such as the abrupt withdrawal of several leading candidates or a dramatic shift in the party’s priorities.”<br><br>In summary, while Gretchen Whitmer remains a figure to watch, the overwhelming consensus is that her odds of winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination are slim. For now, prediction markets and expert forecasters agree: Whitmer’s candidacy is a long shot.</div>

With combined forecast probabilities hovering at just 4%, and major prediction markets pricing the odds at 5%, political analysts suggest the GOP is poised to move beyond Trump’s era-defining influence.<br><br>Forecasters point to several factors dampening Trump’s prospects. “The party’s energy has clearly shifted toward newer faces and emerging coalitions,” said Dr. Maria Ellis, a political scientist and election forecaster. “Most Republican primary voters are signaling, both in polling and in early endorsements, that they’re ready for a generational change.”<br><br>In addition to the changing political winds, Trump faces formidable practical obstacles. At 82 in 2028, his age is a subject of ongoing discussion among party strategists concerned about candidate viability in a general election. Several high-profile Republican governors and senators have already assembled national campaign operations, further crowding the field and diluting any lingering ‘Trump effect.’<br><br>Prediction markets, which aggregate bets from thousands of participants, reflect this consensus. “This is one of the lowest probabilities we’ve recorded for a former president seeking the nomination,” said Evan Liu, head of political forecasting at the FutureWagers exchange. “While Trump still commands a loyal base, the market is essentially saying it would take an extraordinary shift in circumstances for him to become the nominee again.”<br><br>The 4% probability assigned by expert panels is consistent with this assessment. As Dr. Ellis notes, “A scenario where Trump accepts the 2028 GOP nomination is not impossible, but it would likely require multiple leading contenders withdrawing, coupled with a dramatic resurgence in his popularity—a combination that seems increasingly remote.”<br><br>Still, some within Trump’s circle have not ruled out a surprise. “Never count him out entirely,” said one longtime adviser, pointing to the former president’s history of upending political expectations. However, most GOP officials and strategists are preparing for a post-Trump era.<br><br>With the party’s nominating convention just weeks away, all signs point toward a new standard-bearer for the Republicans in 2028—leaving Trump’s odds at the edge of possibility, but firmly outside the mainstream forecast.<br><br>*— The Future Times*</div>

However, despite periodic escalations in rhetoric and regional flashpoints, the probability of a US drone, missile, or air strike on Iranian territory before January 14, 2026, remains low, according to the latest aggregated forecasts.<br><br>Current data from major prediction markets indicate a baseline probability of 0% for such an event, reflecting widespread skepticism among traders that the US will take overt military action against Iran within the defined window. Complementing this, a panel of independent forecasters surveyed by The Future Times assigns a combined probability of 37%—a figure that suggests some degree of risk, but still frames a direct strike as more unlikely than not.<br><br>“While there are always tail risks in the region, the political and strategic incentives for a direct US strike on Iran just aren’t there at the moment,” said Dr. Laura Chen, a senior analyst at Strategic Futures Group. “The Biden administration—and any potential successor—seems committed to avoiding escalation, favoring diplomatic and economic pressure over overt military action.”<br><br>Forecasters point to several restraining factors: the risks of sparking a broader regional conflict, potential retaliation against US assets or allies, and ongoing efforts to revive or renegotiate nuclear agreements. Moreover, the precise definition for market resolution—a US-initiated drone, missile, or air strike impacting Iranian soil or official embassies—sets a high bar for what qualifies as a “strike,” excluding cyberattacks, ground incursions, and intercepted munitions.<br><br>Still, a 37% probability should not be dismissed outright. “We can’t entirely rule out the possibility of a dramatic escalation, especially in the event of a significant provocation, such as an attack on US forces in the region or a sudden collapse in diplomatic talks,” noted Jonathan Feld, a geopolitical risk consultant. “History shows that red lines can shift quickly.”<br><br>For now, however, both prediction market data and expert consensus point toward a continuation of the status quo: high-stakes maneuvering and indirect conflict, but no direct US strike on Iranian territory as defined by the market’s criteria—at least through early 2026.<br><br>As always, The Future Times will continue to monitor both prediction markets and expert sentiment for any shifts in the outlook.</div>

This sentiment is echoed by independent forecasting groups, who see no plausible pathway for the West London club to overcome the traditional powerhouses of English football.<br><br>**A Historic Challenge**<br><br>Brentford’s recent campaigns have been marked by spirited performances and a growing reputation for overachieving on a modest budget. However, the leap from mid-table resilience to title-winning dominance is historically rare. “No club outside of the so-called ‘Big Six’ has won the league since Leicester City’s extraordinary run in 2015–16,” noted football analyst Dr. Simon Rowe of the Institute for Sports Analytics. “The structural, financial, and squad depth advantages of these elite clubs make major upsets exceedingly unlikely.”<br><br>**Market Consensus: ‘No’**<br><br>Prediction markets serve as a real-time barometer of collective expectations, aggregating insights from thousands of participants. As of this week, Brentford’s contract on the ‘Will Brentford win the 2025–26 EPL?’ market is trading at the minimum price, signaling universal skepticism. Market participants cite factors such as Brentford’s relatively limited transfer budget, the persistent strength of top-tier rivals, and the club’s current squad profile as reasons for the bleak outlook.<br><br>**Forecasters Align with Market View**<br><br>Expert forecasters surveyed by *The Future Times* also assign a near-zero probability to a Brentford title. “Barring a sequence of unprecedented events — such as a dramatic influx of investment or catastrophic collapses from every major rival — Brentford simply do not have the resources to contend for the title over a 38-game season,” said Rowe.<br><br>**The Long Game**<br><br>While Brentford’s supporters may continue to dream, the consensus among both markets and experts is clear: a Premier League title in 2025–26 remains out of reach. Still, football’s unpredictability is part of its enduring appeal, and the club’s continued presence in the top flight is a testament to its progress in recent years.<br><br>For now, however, the prospect of Brentford rewriting the record books next season is, by all reliable accounts, a bridge too far.</div>

The Verity prediction market, which has tracked Trump’s impact on the Republican Party since his return to the White House, currently places the likelihood at 85%.<br><br>“Trump’s presence is simply inescapable in Republican primaries this cycle,” said Dr. Maya Eldridge, a political scientist and election forecaster. “We are consistently seeing candidates touting Trump’s endorsement, and even those who distance themselves are forced to define their campaigns in relation to him.”<br><br>This dynamic is playing out in races across the country. In pivotal Senate and House contests, Trump-endorsed candidates have dominated headlines and fundraising, while those perceived as insufficiently loyal have faced tough questions from primary voters. Trump’s ongoing rallies—often televised live—continue to energize his base, while his social media commentary shapes the daily news cycle and, by extension, the political priorities of Republican candidates.<br><br>Forecasters point to recent polling and voting patterns as further evidence. In states such as Ohio, Arizona, and Georgia, Trump’s endorsements have translated into measurable boosts for candidates in primary races, often eclipsing traditional party support or even local issues. “We’re seeing turnout spikes in districts where Trump has held rallies or intervened in candidate selection,” said analyst Marcus Reilly of the Futures Political Observatory. “There’s little doubt he’s the dominant factor motivating Republican voters.”<br><br>While some analysts caution that other factors—such as economic performance, local issues, or Democratic strategies—could influence the general election, the consensus in forecasting circles is clear: Trump’s persona, policies, and endorsements are expected to be decisive through the primary season and likely beyond.<br><br>As the 2026 midterms draw nearer, all signs point to a political landscape still deeply shaped by Trump’s unique appeal and polarizing presence. For Republican candidates and voters alike, the Trump factor is not just influential—it is, in the eyes of most forecasters, unavoidable.</div>
