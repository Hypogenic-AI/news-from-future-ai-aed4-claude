    "article": "**Trump Unlikely to Tap Waller for Fed Chair, Forecasters Say**\n\n**June 21, 2025 \u2013 Washington, D.C.**\n\nDespite speculation surrounding key appointments in a potential second Trump administration, prediction markets and expert forecasters are nearly unanimous: Christopher Waller is not expected to receive the formal nomination for Chair of the Federal Reserve by President Donald Trump, should the opportunity arise before the end of 2026.\n\nAs of this week, leading prediction markets such as PredictIt and Kalshi assign a virtually nonexistent probability\u20140%\u2014to the scenario in which Trump submits Waller\u2019s name to the U.S. Senate for the top central banking post. This consensus is echoed by economic forecasters surveyed by The Future Times, who point to both political dynamics and recent public statements as factors diminishing Waller\u2019s prospects.\n\nWaller, who currently serves as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has maintained a relatively low profile compared to other potential candidates. Although respected in monetary policy circles for his academic rigor and dovish leanings, Waller lacks the vocal advocacy of Trump\u2019s economic agenda that some observers believe the former president will prioritize in his selection.\n\n\u201cWaller is seen as a steady hand, but he\u2019s not closely aligned with Trump\u2019s preferred policies or messaging,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Chen, a senior fellow at the Center for Presidential Appointments. \u201cGiven Trump\u2019s past criticisms of the Fed and his desire for a more compliant central bank, the markets are reflecting the near-impossibility of Waller\u2019s nomination.\u201d\n\nThe nomination process for Fed chair is closely watched by investors and policymakers alike, with the formal submission of a nominee\u2019s name to the U.S. Senate serving as the definitive signal of presidential intent. Acting or interim appointments, while occasionally floated in media reports, would not satisfy the formal criteria required for market resolution.\n\nSeveral other names have consistently topped forecaster shortlists, with speculation centering on figures seen as more overtly aligned with Trump\u2019s economic worldview. These include Judy Shelton, a former Trump nominee to the Fed board known for her unconventional views on monetary policy, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and frequent critic of the current central bank leadership.\n\nWhile political surprises remain theoretically possible, the current market probability leaves little room for ambiguity: economic and political experts expect Trump, if elected, to look elsewhere for his Fed chair pick. As forecasters put it, \u201cThere\u2019s simply no credible pathway for Waller\u2019s nomination under the current political calculus.\u201d",

Market participants on international betting exchanges posted similar odds, with the likelihood of open and unfiltered internet access before May estimated at 34% as of this week.\n\nThe crisis began in late December, when the Iranian rial plummeted to record lows against the US dollar, prompting the largest street protests in three years. The unrest escalated after the resignation of the Central Bank chief, as demonstrators\u2014spanning major cities and provincial towns\u2014voiced anger about economic hardship and political repression. The government\u2019s response has been characteristically forceful. Security forces have cracked down on demonstrators, and authorities have reportedly tightened digital restrictions further, seeking to disrupt the organization of protests and limit foreign media coverage.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the Iranian government has relied on heavy internet filtering and whitelisting as a central tool for stifling dissent,\u201d said one regional analyst consulted by The Future Times. \u201cGiven the severity of the current protests, there\u2019s little indication that Tehran will reverse course and embrace a freer internet in the near term.\u201d\n\nSome Western leaders, including the US President, have publicly threatened Iran\u2019s leadership and voiced support for protesters\u2019 demands. For a brief moment, hopes were raised among demonstrators and exiled opposition figures, including Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, that international pressure might force the government to loosen digital restrictions. However, most forecasters remain unconvinced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance that a dramatic political shift or a rapid collapse in government control could result in a sudden opening of the internet,\u201d noted one prediction market participant. \u201cBut as things stand, that remains an outside scenario.\u201d\n\nWhile a minority of experts point to the unpredictable nature of mass movements and the possibility of regime change, the consensus in forecasting circles is that Iran\u2019s internet will likely remain \u201cheavily filtered or whitelisted\u201d for most citizens at least through mid-2026. As the protest movement endures and the government doubles down on digital censorship, the odds of a near-term breakthrough in online freedom appear slim.",

According to a composite of prediction markets and expert analysts surveyed by *The Future Times*, there is currently a 37% chance that Greene will seek a higher office\u2014such as U.S. Senate or governor\u2014before 2029.\n\nGreene, a Republican firebrand who has represented Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District since 2021, has consistently attracted national attention for her unapologetic, often polarizing stances. After securing a third term in 2024 with a commanding majority, Greene\u2019s political ambitions have been the subject of frequent debate, particularly following her surprise resignation from the House last year.\n\nAlthough Greene\u2019s departure from Congress sparked fresh rumors of a statewide run, forecasters point to several headwinds. \u201cWhile she commands a loyal base in northwest Georgia, winning a statewide Republican primary\u2014and especially a general election\u2014would present a far tougher challenge,\u201d said Dr. Evelyn Brooks, a political science professor at Emory University and contributing forecaster. \u201cHer controversial national profile is both an asset and a liability.\u201d\n\nPrediction markets echo this caution. As of this week, the leading platforms assign only a 35% probability to Greene pursuing a Georgia-wide office before 2029, with most traders citing the state\u2019s recent shift toward more competitive elections and the Republican establishment\u2019s reluctance to embrace high-profile disruptors in critical races.\n\nStill, Greene\u2019s capacity to surprise should not be underestimated. \u201cShe has repeatedly defied expectations,\u201d noted one prominent forecaster, \u201cand if a high-profile seat\u2014such as Senator Jon Ossoff\u2019s\u2014opens up, she could decide to make her move.\u201d Nevertheless, the consensus remains that, barring a dramatic turn in Georgia GOP politics or a surge in grassroots momentum, Greene is more likely to remain a national media figure and conservative influencer outside of elected office, at least in the near term.\n\nAs Georgia\u2019s political landscape continues to evolve, observers will be watching closely for any signs of movement from Greene or her allies. For now, however, the weight of expert and market opinion suggests her path to the state\u2019s highest offices remains uncertain\u2014and, at least for the next few years, improbable.",

Current aggregated data puts the Rockets\u2019 chances at just 4%\u2014a stark reminder of the uphill battle ahead for the franchise.\n\nPrediction markets, which aggregate insights from thousands of bettors and analysts, have consistently priced the Rockets as long shots for the 2026 NBA Finals. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly excitement around the team\u2019s recent draft picks and the development of key players like Jalen Green and Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn,\u201d said one NBA-focused forecaster, \u201cbut the Western Conference remains extremely competitive, and the Rockets haven\u2019t yet demonstrated they can contend with top-tier teams.\u201d\n\nThe 2023-24 season offered flashes of potential, with the Rockets showing improved defense and more cohesive play under head coach Ime Udoka. Offseason moves and continued player development could help, but most observers believe the team is still in the midst of a multi-year rebuild. \u201cThey\u2019re on the right path, but winning a championship by 2026 would require a dramatic leap\u2014either through superstar acquisition or an unexpected breakout,\u201d another analyst told *The Future Times*.\n\nExperts point to a crowded Western Conference, with established powerhouses like the Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, and Golden State Warriors all likely to maintain deep playoff ambitions. Additionally, emerging threats from teams such as the Oklahoma City Thunder and Sacramento Kings further complicate the Rockets\u2019 path to the Finals.\n\nHistorically, NBA championships are often won by teams with a blend of high-level experience, established chemistry, and at least one All-NBA caliber star. While the Rockets\u2019 young core shows promise, forecasters emphasize that time and roster stability are crucial ingredients typically absent from teams making sudden championship runs.\n\nWith a 4% probability, prediction market data suggests a Rockets title in 2026 would be seen as a major upset\u2014though not entirely off the table. \u201cBasketball is full of surprises,\u201d said one market participant. \u201cA transformative trade, a meteoric rise from a young star, or unforeseen setbacks for rivals could always shift the landscape. But as things stand, Houston fans should temper expectations for 2026.\u201d\n\nFor now, all eyes remain on the team\u2019s development, with hope that the seeds being planted today could bear fruit in seasons to come\u2014even if a 2026 title remains highly improbable.",

According to aggregated forecasts tracked by The Future Times, there is an 87% probability that the midterms will meet widely accepted democratic standards, echoing the 88% confidence expressed by leading prediction markets.\n\nThis outlook comes as the nation continues to grapple with the so-called \u201cVerity controversy,\u201d in which allegations about voting procedures and election integrity have circulated widely on social media and partisan news outlets. Despite these tensions, analysts point to the robust institutional mechanisms underpinning U.S. elections\u2014ranging from transparent ballot handling to the decentralized nature of election administration\u2014as key factors supporting this confident forecast.\n\n\u201cWhile there is always the potential for isolated incidents or high-profile disputes, the overall system remains resilient,\u201d said Dr. Alicia Ramirez, a political scientist and election observer affiliated with the Election Integrity Consortium. \u201cEvery credible indicator\u2014from legal frameworks to physical security\u2014suggests that eligible voters will be able to cast their ballots without undue obstruction, and that results will be tabulated accurately.\u201d\n\nPrediction markets have responded accordingly, with shares in a \u201cfree and fair\u201d verdict trading at near-historic highs. This reflects both the experience of recent cycles\u2014where claims of widespread fraud failed to materialize under rigorous scrutiny\u2014and ongoing investments in election transparency. Forecasters note that bipartisan observer access, clear audit trails, and improved poll worker training have all contributed to the buoyant outlook.\n\nStill, a vocal minority continues to question the process, fueled by the Verity controversy and heightened partisan rhetoric. Experts caution that while these narratives may persist in some circles, they are unlikely to shift the broader judgment rendered by reputable observer missions and legal authorities.\n\n\u201cElection trust is as much about perception as about fact, and restoring full confidence among all Americans will remain an ongoing challenge,\u201d said Ramirez. \u201cBut as of now, the evidence points overwhelmingly toward a free and fair contest.\u201d\n\nWith election day fast approaching, all eyes remain on state and local officials tasked with upholding the nation\u2019s democratic tradition.

Their decentralized, non-sectarian approach has earned praise from humanitarian organizations and led to honors such as the Right Livelihood Award and the Rafto Prize in 2024.\n\nIn 2025, the ERRs emerged as leading contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize, topping the PRIO Director\u2019s widely-followed shortlist. On the prediction platform Polymarket, traders assigned them a 33% chance of winning\u2014then the highest among all candidates. However, the Nobel committee ultimately awarded the prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, passing over the ERRs despite their humanitarian achievements.\n\n**Diminishing Prospects in 2026**\n\nLooking to this year\u2019s prize, both forecasters and prediction markets have grown more circumspect. The combined forecast probability stands at just 21%, with Polymarket odds at 23% as of June\u2014down from last year\u2019s peak. According to the consensus among expert forecasters cited by The Future Times, the ERRs\u2019 previous near-win may paradoxically work against them. \u201cThe committee rarely awards the same group or cause in consecutive years, and there\u2019s often a desire to highlight new crises or underrecognized actors,\u201d explains one forecaster.\n\nAdditionally, observers note that the Nobel committee tends to favor initiatives with clear links to conflict resolution or peace negotiations. While the ERRs\u2019 lifesaving work has mitigated suffering, it is less directly tied to formal peace processes in Sudan, which remain stalled.\n\n**Still a Symbol of Hope**\n\nWhile a 2026 Nobel win appears unlikely, analysts caution against ruling the ERRs out entirely. \u201cTheir example of decentralized, citizen-led humanitarianism resonates globally, especially as traditional aid structures face mounting challenges,\u201d one prediction market commentator points out. \u201cShould the committee wish to send a powerful message about grassroots resilience, the ERRs remain a compelling choice.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, the balance of probability suggests the Nobel spotlight will shine elsewhere this October\u2014though the legacy of Sudan\u2019s volunteer responders continues to inspire far beyond their borders.",

This outcome marks the end of a season that, while full of promise at its outset, ultimately fell short of expectations for the New Orleans franchise.\n\nThe Pelicans\u2019 elimination came after a hard-fought but ultimately unsuccessful battle in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs, where they fell to the higher-seeded Phoenix Suns in a six-game series. Despite the efforts of star forward Zion Williamson and a resurgent Brandon Ingram, the team was unable to overcome injuries and inconsistent play down the stretch.

Jordan (*Sinners*). \u201cWhile Moura\u2019s performance is widely respected and his Golden Globe win is significant, Oscar voters have historically favored familiar Hollywood names, especially in crowded years like this one,\u201d said Sofia Rios, a film industry analyst and regular contributor to prediction platforms.\n\nSources within the prediction markets are also wary of drawing too direct a line from Moura\u2019s Golden Globe victory to Oscar gold. \u201cThere\u2019s a correlation, but it\u2019s far from a guarantee,\u201d noted one market analyst. \u201cThe Academy\u2019s voting body can be unpredictable, and past years have seen Globe winners passed over for the Oscar.\u201d\n\nStill, some forecasters caution against ruling out Moura entirely. \u201cA 21% chance is not zero,\u201d Rios emphasized. \u201cHis win would be a watershed moment for Latin American cinema and could resonate with voters looking to make history.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, the prevailing view remains skeptical. Unless a surge of late-breaking support materializes, prediction markets and expert forecasters agree: Wagner Moura\u2019s Oscar moment, while not impossible, appears unlikely in 2026.",

    "article": "**Headline:**  \nAnalysts Skeptical of Imminent US Strike on Iran Before 2026, But Risks Remain\n\n**Dateline:**  \nJune 10, 2024 \u2014 Washington, D.C.\n\n**Article:**  \nDespite escalating tensions in the Middle East and periodic saber-rattling from both Washington and Tehran, most forecasters believe that a direct US aerial strike on Iranian soil before January 31, 2026, remains unlikely. According to aggregated prediction market data and expert analysis reviewed by *The Future Times*, the probability of such an event stands at approximately 37%\u2014suggesting that while not out of the question, a US-initiated missile, drone, or airstrike on Iran is still seen as improbable in the near term.\n\nPrediction markets\u2014platforms where traders buy and sell contracts based on the likelihood of future events\u2014currently price in only a minimal chance (0%) that the US will directly strike Iran by early 2026. This caution is echoed by professional forecasters, who point to a number of restraining factors. \u201cThere\u2019s significant political risk to escalation, both regionally and domestically, for the United States,\u201d notes Dr. Linda Raines, a senior Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Futures Group. \u201cWhile the potential for conflict always exists, especially around flashpoints like the Strait of Hormuz or through proxy engagements, direct US strikes on Iranian territory remain a high threshold.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the market\u2019s definition of a qualifying event is strict: only drone, missile, or airstrikes launched by US forces that impact Iranian ground territory or official embassies would count. Intercepted missiles, surface-to-air attacks, cyber operations, and lower-intensity clashes are excluded. This narrow criterion further dampens expectations among market participants.\n\nRecent months have witnessed renewed hostilities between Iran and US allies in the region, notably in Syria, Iraq, and the Red Sea. However, forecasters highlight a consistent pattern of both sides avoiding direct, attributable actions that could trigger a broader conflict. \u201cThe strategic calculus for Washington is to contain Iranian ambitions without crossing the line into open warfare,\u201d says Raines.\n\nStill, a 37% combined probability is not insignificant and reflects enduring uncertainty. A major provocation\u2014such as a high-casualty attack on US personnel or a collapse in diplomatic backchannels\u2014could shift the calculus rapidly. \u201cMarkets are hedging for the unexpected,\u201d explains market watcher Tom Becker. \u201cIt\u2019s not the base case, but the tail risk is always there.\u201d\n\nFor now, the consensus is clear: while regional volatility persists, the odds do not favor a direct US strike on Iran before January 2026. Nonetheless, the situation remains fluid, and The Future Times will continue to monitor developments as the deadline approaches.",

Winfrey, who has long been the subject of presidential rumors and draft campaigns, remains a figure of fascination for political observers. Nevertheless, the consensus among prediction markets and seasoned political analysts is clear: the odds of Winfrey emerging as the Democratic nominee are exceedingly slim.\n\nCurrently, major prediction markets assign just a 1% probability to the scenario in which Winfrey secures and accepts the party\u2019s nomination. This figure reflects a combination of factors, including the lack of concrete signals from Winfrey herself, the increasing professionalization of the Democratic primary process, and the presence of several established political figures already positioning themselves for a 2028 run.\n\n\u201cWhile Oprah Winfrey\u2019s name recognition and public goodwill are virtually unmatched, the pathway from media stardom to party standard-bearer remains steep,\u201d noted political forecaster Dr. Lena Kim, contributing to a recent expert panel. \u201cWe see no evidence of the organizational groundwork, policy positioning, or grassroots mobilization that typically precede a viable presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nPrediction markets, which aggregate the views of thousands of participants wagering real or reputational stakes, echo these assessments. Their pricing suggests that, barring a dramatic and highly unlikely turn of events, Winfrey will not be the Democratic Party\u2019s choice in 2028.\n\nSome forecasters caution against wholly discounting the possibility, citing the unpredictable nature of American politics and Winfrey\u2019s unique ability to command attention. \u201cIn theory, a late-breaking groundswell or a crisis demanding an outsider could alter the landscape,\u201d said Jonathan Perez, a senior analyst at Political Futures Exchange. \u201cBut at present, these are remote hypotheticals rather than plausible scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s official nomination process, which involves a sprawling primary and caucus system, is likely to favor seasoned politicians with extensive networks and electoral experience. Unless Winfrey were to signal a dramatic change in direction, the prevailing wisdom is that she will remain an influential commentator rather than a candidate.\n\nWith a combined forecast probability of just 1%, the prospect of an Oprah Winfrey nomination remains firmly in the realm of political long shots\u2014much discussed, but almost universally expected not to materialize.",

These concerns have been amplified by partisan messaging and viral social media campaigns, but have not been matched by evidence of systemic risk.\n\nAccording to aggregated prediction market data, the likelihood of non-citizen voting occurring on a scale significant enough to influence federal election outcomes remains vanishingly small. \u201cThe markets are reflecting what we know from history and law enforcement: cases of non-citizen voting are extremely rare and are typically detected and prosecuted,\u201d explained Sarah Zang, a senior forecaster at the Future Democracy Initiative.\n\nWhile a handful of local jurisdictions in the United States do allow non-citizen residents to vote in specific municipal or school board elections, these policies are legally distinct and explicitly barred from being applied to federal contests. State and local officials have repeatedly affirmed the robust safeguards in place, including citizenship verification protocols and cross-checks with federal databases.\n\nThe persistence of this issue in political discourse is not new. Similar concerns surfaced in previous election cycles, yet comprehensive investigations\u2014including those by the Government Accountability Office and independent watchdogs\u2014have consistently revealed only isolated cases, with no evidence of widespread violations.\n\nIn summary, while the specter of non-citizen voting continues to animate segments of the political landscape, both expert forecasters and the prediction markets are nearly unanimous: widespread non-citizen participation in the 2026 U.S. midterms is exceedingly unlikely. As Election Day approaches, the focus is likely to remain on more probable factors shaping the outcome of the races.",

With market probabilities climbing to 96% and aggregated forecasting models settling at 91%, Warsh\u2019s nomination is now seen as all but certain.\n\nThe formal nomination process, which requires the President to submit a nomination message to the U.S. Senate, is expected to take place before the end-of-year deadline stipulated by federal law. While the Trump administration has not yet made an official announcement, sources close to the transition team indicate that internal vetting of Warsh is complete and that preparations for the Senate submission are underway.\n\nWarsh, who served as a Federal Reserve Governor from 2006 to 2011, has long been considered a frontrunner for the post. He is known for his comparatively hawkish views on monetary policy and his previous advocacy for a stronger U.S. dollar\u2014positions that align closely with the Trump administration\u2019s stated economic priorities. Insiders say Warsh\u2019s experience navigating the 2008 financial crisis, as well as his ties to both Wall Street and previous Republican administrations, have made him a broadly acceptable choice within conservative policy circles.\n\nPrediction markets have reflected growing certainty around Warsh\u2019s nomination over the past month, with trading volumes surging as leading financial publications and expert forecasters have echoed the likelihood of his selection. \u201cThe probability of Warsh\u2019s nomination is now very high,\u201d said one senior forecaster at the independent platform Metaculus. \u201cWhile there\u2019s always a non-zero chance of a late-stage shift, all current signals point to Warsh as Trump\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d\n\nShould Warsh\u2019s nomination proceed as expected, the Senate will then deliberate on his confirmation. Although some progressive lawmakers are likely to raise concerns about his policy stances, analysts expect that Warsh\u2019s extensive experience and bipartisan respect within financial circles will smooth the path to confirmation.\n\nAs the White House readies its formal submission to the Senate, market participants and policymakers alike are bracing for a new era at the Federal Reserve\u2014one that, forecasters agree, is likely to be shaped by Kevin Warsh\u2019s steady, if resolutely hawkish, hand.",

The Department of Justice launched its probe late last year, citing alleged improprieties in contract awards and oversight. While the investigation has drawn considerable media attention and prompted calls for transparency on Capitol Hill, experts and market participants alike currently see a limited chance of Powell\u2019s early departure.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, the probability Powell leaves the Board before his term ends is quite low,\u201d says Dr. Evelyn Carter, a senior policy forecaster at the Center for Political Futures. \u201cPrediction markets have consistently priced this scenario at around 20 percent, and our own aggregated model puts the odds only slightly higher at 23 percent. Unless the DOJ uncovers evidence of egregious misconduct, institutional inertia and Powell\u2019s own resolve are likely to prevail.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Federal Reserve chairs have tended to resign their governorships upon or shortly after stepping down as chair. Powell\u2019s current term as chair is set to expire in May 2026, but his governorship runs through January 2028. Many observers expect Powell to follow custom, but note that an early resignation would be highly unusual unless legally compelled or politically untenable.\n\n\u201cPowell\u2019s credibility and the Fed\u2019s independence are both at stake, but so far there\u2019s little to suggest imminent action,\u201d notes a leading prediction market analyst. \u201cAbsent clear findings from the DOJ, markets are betting he\u2019ll see out at least his term as chair, and possibly longer.\u201d\n\nWith the investigation still in its early stages and no substantive findings released, the consensus among prediction markets and expert forecasters is that Powell is likely to remain in office. However, observers caution that these probabilities could shift rapidly if the probe yields significant new evidence.\n\nFor now, the future of the Fed\u2019s leadership appears steady, albeit under a cloud of uncertainty. As one senior forecaster put it, \u201cUnless the facts change, Powell\u2019s position seems secure.\u201d",

The suit alleges that Meta and WhatsApp \u201cstore, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users\u2019 purportedly \u2018private\u2019 communications,\u201d directly contradicting WhatsApp\u2019s repeated assurances to users that \u201conly people in this chat can read, listen to, or share\u201d messages.\n\nYet, according to aggregated data from major prediction markets and leading forecasting panels, the probability that credible evidence will surface before the end of 2026 remains modest. As of this publication, the consensus forecast pegs the likelihood at just 37%, with prediction markets reflecting a split sentiment\u2014hovering at 50%\u2014but overall leaning toward skepticism.\n\n\u201cWhile the allegations are serious and the stakes are high for Meta, so far there is little public evidence to suggest a breach of end-to-end encryption has occurred,\u201d said one senior technology forecaster, speaking on background. \u201cThe Signal Protocol, which WhatsApp has implemented since 2016, is widely regarded as robust. Unless there is a catastrophic discovery\u2014such as a whistleblower leak or a technical expos\u00e9\u2014most experts see this lawsuit as unlikely to result in a smoking gun, at least in the near future.\u201d\n\nLegal experts note that discovery in US federal court could theoretically force Meta to reveal technical details about its encryption implementation.

While the probability of a decisive revelation by 2027 appears low, ongoing litigation and investigative reporting could still surface new information, keeping this issue firmly in the international spotlight.\n\nFor now, users and observers alike are left watching the courts\u2014and the code\u2014closely, as Meta\u2019s privacy assurances face their toughest challenge yet.",

As of this week, aggregated market data put the probability at virtually zero percent, while combined expert forecasts suggest a modest 37% chance\u2014underscoring the prevailing skepticism about a near-term escalation into overt military confrontation.\n\nThe specific scenario under consideration involves a US-initiated aerial or missile strike impacting Iranian territory or official diplomatic facilities. According to the rules set by leading prediction markets, only the use of bombs, drones, or missiles by US forces on recognized Iranian sites would qualify for this classification. Incidents involving intercepted munitions, ground assaults, or cyber operations would not meet the threshold.\n\nTensions in the region have waxed and waned in recent years, with flashpoints in the Strait of Hormuz and intermittent proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Yet, both US and Iranian leaders have repeatedly signaled a desire to avoid direct conflict, mindful of the potential for rapid escalation and destabilization.\n\n\"While the rhetoric is heated and the region remains volatile, the appetite in Washington for a direct strike on Iran\u2019s territory appears limited,\" said a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic Futures, echoing sentiments expressed by several market-based forecasters. \"The administration is likely to continue relying on pressure through sanctions and regional alliances, rather than risking a direct military engagement.\"\n\nPrediction markets, which aggregate the views of thousands of participants and often outperform individual expert predictions, are particularly bearish on the likelihood of a strike in the coming months. The market\u2019s zero percent pricing reflects a consensus that, barring an extraordinary provocation, the status quo will hold.\n\nStill, with a 37% probability assigned by some expert forecasters, the possibility cannot be entirely discounted. Potential triggers\u2014including a major escalation with Iranian proxies, attacks on US personnel in the region, or unforeseen diplomatic breakdowns\u2014remain within the realm of plausibility.\n\nFor now, however, the balance of evidence\u2014and the collective wisdom of both experts and prediction markets\u2014suggests that a US aerial or missile strike on Iranian territory before February 2026 is more unlikely than not. As always, observers caution that rapid shifts in the geopolitical landscape could still upend prevailing expectations.",

The near-consensus among political analysts suggests that, barring an unexpected shift in the political landscape, Whitmer is not expected to emerge as the party\u2019s standard-bearer.\n\n\u201cWhitmer enjoys strong approval ratings in Michigan and has gained national attention for her handling of crises and her centrist appeal,\u201d said Dr. Lena Morales, a senior political forecaster at the Futures Institute. \u201cBut at this stage, she faces a Democratic field crowded with high-profile contenders, including several with deeper national networks and fundraising bases.\u201d\n\nPrediction markets, which aggregate the bets and expectations of thousands of participants, reflect this sentiment. Traders have consistently priced Whitmer\u2019s chances well below those of potential frontrunners such as Vice President Luis Padilla, Senator Alexandra Lee, and California Governor Mark Evans. \u201cUnless there is a seismic event or a major realignment within the party, Whitmer is not viewed as a likely nominee,\u201d noted one market analyst.\n\nExperts attribute Whitmer\u2019s low odds to several factors: the party\u2019s current momentum toward coastal and Sun Belt candidates, her relatively moderate policy stances in an increasingly progressive primary electorate, and the lack of a robust national campaign organization. While Whitmer has not formally declared her candidacy, her recent speaking engagements and political action committee activity have fueled speculation. Still, forecasters remain unmoved.\n\n\u201cPolitical fortunes can change rapidly,\u201d cautioned Dr. Morales. \u201cBut based on all available data, Whitmer\u2019s path to the nomination would require extraordinary developments\u2014such as the abrupt withdrawal of several leading candidates or a dramatic shift in the party\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nIn summary, while Gretchen Whitmer remains a figure to watch, the overwhelming consensus is that her odds of winning the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination are slim. For now, prediction markets and expert forecasters agree: Whitmer\u2019s candidacy is a long shot.",

With combined forecast probabilities hovering at just 4%, and major prediction markets pricing the odds at 5%, political analysts suggest the GOP is poised to move beyond Trump\u2019s era-defining influence.\n\nForecasters point to several factors dampening Trump\u2019s prospects. \u201cThe party\u2019s energy has clearly shifted toward newer faces and emerging coalitions,\u201d said Dr. Maria Ellis, a political scientist and election forecaster. \u201cMost Republican primary voters are signaling, both in polling and in early endorsements, that they\u2019re ready for a generational change.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the changing political winds, Trump faces formidable practical obstacles. At 82 in 2028, his age is a subject of ongoing discussion among party strategists concerned about candidate viability in a general election. Several high-profile Republican governors and senators have already assembled national campaign operations, further crowding the field and diluting any lingering \u2018Trump effect.\u2019\n\nPrediction markets, which aggregate bets from thousands of participants, reflect this consensus. \u201cThis is one of the lowest probabilities we\u2019ve recorded for a former president seeking the nomination,\u201d said Evan Liu, head of political forecasting at the FutureWagers exchange. \u201cWhile Trump still commands a loyal base, the market is essentially saying it would take an extraordinary shift in circumstances for him to become the nominee again.\u201d\n\nThe 4% probability assigned by expert panels is consistent with this assessment. As Dr. Ellis notes, \u201cA scenario where Trump accepts the 2028 GOP nomination is not impossible, but it would likely require multiple leading contenders withdrawing, coupled with a dramatic resurgence in his popularity\u2014a combination that seems increasingly remote.\u201d\n\nStill, some within Trump\u2019s circle have not ruled out a surprise. \u201cNever count him out entirely,\u201d said one longtime adviser, pointing to the former president\u2019s history of upending political expectations. However, most GOP officials and strategists are preparing for a post-Trump era.\n\nWith the party\u2019s nominating convention just weeks away, all signs point toward a new standard-bearer for the Republicans in 2028\u2014leaving Trump\u2019s odds at the edge of possibility, but firmly outside the mainstream forecast.\n\n*\u2014 The Future Times*",

However, despite periodic escalations in rhetoric and regional flashpoints, the probability of a US drone, missile, or air strike on Iranian territory before January 14, 2026, remains low, according to the latest aggregated forecasts.\n\nCurrent data from major prediction markets indicate a baseline probability of 0% for such an event, reflecting widespread skepticism among traders that the US will take overt military action against Iran within the defined window. Complementing this, a panel of independent forecasters surveyed by The Future Times assigns a combined probability of 37%\u2014a figure that suggests some degree of risk, but still frames a direct strike as more unlikely than not.\n\n\u201cWhile there are always tail risks in the region, the political and strategic incentives for a direct US strike on Iran just aren\u2019t there at the moment,\u201d said Dr. Laura Chen, a senior analyst at Strategic Futures Group. \u201cThe Biden administration\u2014and any potential successor\u2014seems committed to avoiding escalation, favoring diplomatic and economic pressure over overt military action.\u201d\n\nForecasters point to several restraining factors: the risks of sparking a broader regional conflict, potential retaliation against US assets or allies, and ongoing efforts to revive or renegotiate nuclear agreements. Moreover, the precise definition for market resolution\u2014a US-initiated drone, missile, or air strike impacting Iranian soil or official embassies\u2014sets a high bar for what qualifies as a \u201cstrike,\u201d excluding cyberattacks, ground incursions, and intercepted munitions.\n\nStill, a 37% probability should not be dismissed outright. \u201cWe can\u2019t entirely rule out the possibility of a dramatic escalation, especially in the event of a significant provocation, such as an attack on US forces in the region or a sudden collapse in diplomatic talks,\u201d noted Jonathan Feld, a geopolitical risk consultant. \u201cHistory shows that red lines can shift quickly.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, both prediction market data and expert consensus point toward a continuation of the status quo: high-stakes maneuvering and indirect conflict, but no direct US strike on Iranian territory as defined by the market\u2019s criteria\u2014at least through early 2026.\n\nAs always, The Future Times will continue to monitor both prediction markets and expert sentiment for any shifts in the outlook.",

This sentiment is echoed by independent forecasting groups, who see no plausible pathway for the West London club to overcome the traditional powerhouses of English football.\n\n**A Historic Challenge**\n\nBrentford\u2019s recent campaigns have been marked by spirited performances and a growing reputation for overachieving on a modest budget. However, the leap from mid-table resilience to title-winning dominance is historically rare. \u201cNo club outside of the so-called \u2018Big Six\u2019 has won the league since Leicester City\u2019s extraordinary run in 2015\u201316,\u201d noted football analyst Dr. Simon Rowe of the Institute for Sports Analytics. \u201cThe structural, financial, and squad depth advantages of these elite clubs make major upsets exceedingly unlikely.\u201d\n\n**Market Consensus: \u2018No\u2019**\n\nPrediction markets serve as a real-time barometer of collective expectations, aggregating insights from thousands of participants. As of this week, Brentford\u2019s contract on the \u2018Will Brentford win the 2025\u201326 EPL?\u2019 market is trading at the minimum price, signaling universal skepticism. Market participants cite factors such as Brentford\u2019s relatively limited transfer budget, the persistent strength of top-tier rivals, and the club\u2019s current squad profile as reasons for the bleak outlook.\n\n**Forecasters Align with Market View**\n\nExpert forecasters surveyed by *The Future Times* also assign a near-zero probability to a Brentford title. \u201cBarring a sequence of unprecedented events \u2014 such as a dramatic influx of investment or catastrophic collapses from every major rival \u2014 Brentford simply do not have the resources to contend for the title over a 38-game season,\u201d said Rowe.\n\n**The Long Game**\n\nWhile Brentford\u2019s supporters may continue to dream, the consensus among both markets and experts is clear: a Premier League title in 2025\u201326 remains out of reach. Still, football\u2019s unpredictability is part of its enduring appeal, and the club\u2019s continued presence in the top flight is a testament to its progress in recent years.\n\nFor now, however, the prospect of Brentford rewriting the record books next season is, by all reliable accounts, a bridge too far.",

    "article": "**Trump Poised to Be Decisive Force in 2026 Midterms, Forecasters Say**\n\n*Washington, D.C. | July 2, 2026*\n\nAs the nation approaches the pivotal 2026 midterm elections, prediction markets and political forecasters are nearly unanimous: Donald Trump, the incumbent president, is set to be a primary voting factor for Republicans\u2014and potentially for the broader electorate as well.\n\nAccording to aggregated forecasts from leading prediction platforms, there is an 86% probability that Trump\u2019s influence will drive primary voting behavior in the midterms, both through direct endorsements and by shaping the policy conversation nationwide. The Verity prediction market, which has tracked Trump\u2019s impact on the Republican Party since his return to the White House, currently places the likelihood at 85%.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s presence is simply inescapable in Republican primaries this cycle,\u201d said Dr. Maya Eldridge, a political scientist and election forecaster. \u201cWe are consistently seeing candidates touting Trump\u2019s endorsement, and even those who distance themselves are forced to define their campaigns in relation to him.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic is playing out in races across the country. In pivotal Senate and House contests, Trump-endorsed candidates have dominated headlines and fundraising, while those perceived as insufficiently loyal have faced tough questions from primary voters. Trump\u2019s ongoing rallies\u2014often televised live\u2014continue to energize his base, while his social media commentary shapes the daily news cycle and, by extension, the political priorities of Republican candidates.\n\nForecasters point to recent polling and voting patterns as further evidence. In states such as Ohio, Arizona, and Georgia, Trump\u2019s endorsements have translated into measurable boosts for candidates in primary races, often eclipsing traditional party support or even local issues. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing turnout spikes in districts where Trump has held rallies or intervened in candidate selection,\u201d said analyst Marcus Reilly of the Futures Political Observatory. \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt he\u2019s the dominant factor motivating Republican voters.\u201d\n\nWhile some analysts caution that other factors\u2014such as economic performance, local issues, or Democratic strategies\u2014could influence the general election, the consensus in forecasting circles is clear: Trump\u2019s persona, policies, and endorsements are expected to be decisive through the primary season and likely beyond.\n\nAs the 2026 midterms draw nearer, all signs point to a political landscape still deeply shaped by Trump\u2019s unique appeal and polarizing presence. For Republican candidates and voters alike, the Trump factor is not just influential\u2014it is, in the eyes of most forecasters, unavoidable.",
